## Why?
1. It's difficult for artists to find clients for art commissions. Most artists do it through discord servers or mutuals, but it's hard to find new clientele because there's no singular platform for it.
2. On the flip side, it's also hard for clients to find an artist tailored for what you want
3. Popular art commission websites take high fees for transactions
## Purpose:
1. To provide a platform for artists to find commission opportunities.
2. To allow art-enjoyers to view and contact artists willing to work with them
3. To provide a cheaper alternative to other art commission websites
## Usage
- The website is currently deployed with Vercel [at this link](https://art-commission-cdcaev0fq-aggamundus-projects.vercel.app)
